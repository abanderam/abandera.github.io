I am a postdoctoral researcher in the University of Seville (Spain). 

My research focuses on the development of Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) techniques for systems of differential equations. My research topics also include: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Reduced Basis (RB) and Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD). Applications concern: Slow-fast dynamical systems, turbulence models and elliptic PDEs.

I have a PhD in Mathematics. I have been a researcher at the University of Seville in the research group of Profs. Tomás Chacón Rebollo and Macarena Gómez-Mármol.

I have been a visiting researcher at the University of Bordeaux, France (with S. Brillet and M. Azaïez, 2 months), at the Univesity of Evry, France (with S. Menozzi and A. Vidal, 2 months).

I speak Spanish, English, German and French.
